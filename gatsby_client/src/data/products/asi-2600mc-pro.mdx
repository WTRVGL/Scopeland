### ZWO ASI2600MC Pro - powerful color astro camera of the latest generation

ZWO has taken another step forward with this new camera. The colour sensor in APS-C format convinces with its extremely high sensitivity and 16-bit data depth. Even with longer exposure times, the stars will not burn out. You get a much better dynamic.

One of the outstanding features of the ASI 2600MC Pro is its sensational light sensitivity. The QE of 80% by the BACK ILLUMINATION technology and the non-existent amplifier glow make the camera very suitable for all astronomical applications, but especially for deep sky astrophotography.

The "single shot" colour camera offers more comfort than monochrome cameras. Not everyone wants to go through the laborious L-RGB process for beautiful coloured nebula or planet images. The color cameras offer you the possibility to get beautiful pictures without changing filters. In direct comparison to the DSLR camera, the ASI camera convinces with a much higher light sensitivity, a smoother image and significantly more depth. Stars donÂ´t burn out that easy.
