### ATIK CMOS Camera ACIS 7.1 Color - Sony Sensor with 17.6 mm Diagonal
The ACIS 7.1 is ATIK´s fastest camera yet with full frame speeds of up to 28 fps. Designed not only to exceed the high demands required for scientific imaging, the ACIS 7.1 also performs expertly in astronomical imaging. Manufactured at ATIK´s ISO 9001 certified European premises to the very highest standards, the ACIS 7.1 is designed to provide reliable and excellent service for many years.

The Sony IMX428 CMOS sensor at the heart of the ACIS 7.1 rivals some CCD sensors for sensitivity, whilst the 4.5 µm pixel size ensures that this is a versatile camera suitable for use with a range of telescopes.

An innovative design based upon the Sony IMX428 sensor, the ACIS 7.1 houses the 7.1MP sensor in a dried, air-tight environment which is sealed to industrial standards to enable condensation free imaging. The camera has low read noise and can image at the rapid speeds at both 12 and 16-bit formats. With the signature Atik blend of form and function, the ACIS 7.1 provides a sensitive, high megapixel sensor at a competitive price point.

The "single shot" color camera offers more comfort, compared with monochrome cameras. Not everyone wants to follow through the laborious L-RGB technique for beautiful colored nebula or planetary images. The color cameras offer a possibility to obtain beautiful images without changing filters.

The ACIS 7.1 also possesses a new case design that has allowed the camera to achieve a cooling delta of -35 °C below ambient, this keeps thermal noise under control, irrespective of where you are imaging from.
