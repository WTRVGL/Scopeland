### TS 76EDPH 6-element FPL53 Flatfield Apochromat

The TS-Optics 76EDPH is intended for astrophotographers and nature photographers who also like to observe through a high-class apo. The refractor convinces by its solid mechanical workmanship and by its high-quality 3-element FPL53 lens. The image is free of annoying chromatic aberration. The 3-element corrector has been specially developed for this apo and produces a purecolor, corrected image field with 44 mm diameter, ideal for full-frame cameras. The fast focal ratio of f/4.5 allows short exposure times. The 76EDPH is a powerful and portable travel apo for astrophotography and observation.
