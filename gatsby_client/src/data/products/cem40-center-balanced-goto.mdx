### iOptron CEM40 - Center-Balanced GoTo Mount

The iOptron® CEM40 mount is the next generation of center-balanced equatorial mounts. This mount is incredibly eye-pleasing, and its beauty is found in more than its appearance. The functionality of the mount is superb. Weighing in at only 15.8 lbs., this mount can support a payload of up to 40 lbs.! That´s incredible!

This mount also has an integrated electronic polar finder scope known as the iPolar. This tool ensures the accurate alignment of a telescope, even when the pole star is obscured. There are large levers on the quick-lock drive engagement system; these large levers make it easy to snap the gears into place.

##### Innovative iOptron Technology

Make way for an innovative mount! This iOptron CEM40 mount uses iOptron´s patent-pending Universal Self-Centering Saddle (USCS). This saddle accommodates Losmandy and Vixen-style dovetail plates. The CEM40 also uses iOptron´s ultra-quiet, low-power consumption stepper motor drive system, aiding the mount in providing precise tracking.

##### Computerized Mount Features

The iOptron CEM40 mount uses the Go2Nova® 8407 hand controller to navigate the night sky. This incredible technology helps observers find celestial objects with the aid of the mount´s 359,000+ object database! For those looking for a telescope that has the capability of tracking and finding beautiful night sky objects, this mount is a must have tool.

With the included tripod, 10lbs. counterweight, and the mount´s computerized technology, observers are just an OTA away from a spectacular viewing experience!
