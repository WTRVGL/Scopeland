### ATIK color CCD camera 490EXc
Only 60mm diameter

The ATIK 490EXc is equipped with the SONY ICX814 9MP chip. This features excellent quantum efficiency and low noise. Due to the high sensitivity of the sensor, the camera is not only suitable for fast telescopes but also for slower systems. Thanks to the compact housing, the ATIK 490EXc is particularly suitable for Hyperstar/Faststar systems.
Another advantage is the low weight of only 400 grams. This places hardly any strain on the focuser. The ATIK 490EXc is particularly economical in power consumption.
