### 10Micron GM 2000 HPS II COMBI GoTo Mount

The new GM 2000 HPS II COMBI combines the solid stability of the GM2000 HPS II Monolith with the portability of the GM 2000 HPS II Ultraport. These two mounts are no longer produced and will be replaced by this successor model.

The new "COMBI" is basically an "Ultraport" ("splittable" in two parts) with an additional locking system; next to the quick locking system, which is very useful to carry and assemble the mount in the field, we added a further locking system. This is meant for customers who have the mount permanently installed in an observatory. It will ensure a great long-term stability, comparable to a GM2000 HPS II Monolith.

You can easily revert the mount into a portable ("splittable") version simply by removing the locking screws. This way the new GM2000 HPS II COMBI combines both advantages of the previous models in one single mount!

The technical specifications, sizes and weight of the new GM 2000 HPS II Combi are exactly the same as of the GM 2000 HPS II Ultraport.
