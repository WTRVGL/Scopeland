### Skywatcher ESPRIT 150 ED Professional FPL53 Triplet Apo

Skwatcher´s largest apochromat, like the other ESPRIT apochromats, was designed for demanding astrophotography. The very well corrected objective offers a high contrast image, free from disturbing chromatic aberrations. Good solid mechanics, such as a stable 3" Linear Power focuser, complement the optics and make the instrument a very good all-around telescope.

### The objective of the ED150:

The triplet objective consists of an FPL53 APO element from Ohara and two additional glasses from SCHOTT, a very well-known glass manufacturer. The three air-spaced lenses are mounted in a stable cell and are also held stable for adjustment. The objective is of course adjustable.

### The 3" Linear Power focuser:

This focuser is superior to conventional Crayford focusers. The draw tube runs on a solid stainless steel rail mounted on the side. Additional stabilization is provided by lateral ball bearings. The focuser carries even heavy accessories over 5 kg without any problems and it does not tilt when locking the position. The main features are:

- Laterally mounted stainless steel running surface
- Dual speed for precise focusing
- 360° rotation capability
- 2" and 1.25" connection, as well as M74x1 and M86x1 male threads for screw adaptations
