### Rainbow Astro RST-135E GoTo Mount with Encoder
This mount uses sophisticated technologies for offering unique features:

###### Lightweight with only 3.4 kg
Although the load capacity is 13.5 kg (maximum 18 kg), the weight of the mount is only 3.4 kg. It fits in one hand, so you dont need a separate large bag for this. The lighter the mount, the greater the frequency of use.

###### Only ±2.5 arcsec PE
A high-resolution encoder from Renishaw is built into the RA axis. As a result, a periodic error of only ±2.5 seconds was achieved. Choose the RST-135E mount if you are bothered or reluctant to use the autoguide system.

###### Counterweights not required
Counterweights not required up to 13.5 kg. It is especially convenient for domestic mobile observation as well as overseas expedition observation.

###### Freed from balancing
The performance of the worm gear mount is sensitive to the balance, but the RST-135E is not. No need to rebalance even if you change the eyepiece or camera.

###### CNC Machining
CNC machined aluminum alloy AL6061 is used for aircraft. Thats why its small, light and stiff. The beauty of the machined surface increases the collection value.
