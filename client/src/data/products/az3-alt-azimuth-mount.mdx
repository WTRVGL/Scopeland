### Skywatcher AZ3 - Alt-Azimuth Mount with manual slow motion controls and with tripod, 5 kg payload
#### This mount is ideal for nature observing as well as for "grab and go" astronomical observing.

Both axes have a manual slow motion control through flexible shafts. This allows you equally well to track a bird in mid-flight, to track a boat on the horizon or a celestial object while it moves across the night-sky. Tracking can be done comfortably and with good precision, so extended visual observing is possible even with high magnifications.

A telescope is attached to the mount using a pair of tube rings (usually included with a telescope. Not included with this mount).

The AZ3 mount comes with a sturdy but light-weight aluminum tripod - adjustable in height from 71 cm to 123 cm. The mount can carry instrument weights up to approximately 5 kg. The AZ3 itself weighs approx. 4.6 kg including the tripod.

The AZ3 can be pointed at any point between the horizon and almost up to the zenith. In azimuth it allows for a 360Â° movement.
