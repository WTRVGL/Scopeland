### The LS60THa is a complete solar telescope with 60 mm aperture and 500 mm focal length.
It comes with two etalons, an external and an internal, matched together. The LS60THaD60 can be used with only the single internal etalon as <0,75 Ångström H-alpha solar telescope, but also with the additionally attached external etalon for <0,55 Ångström bandwidth, with 60 mm clear aperture in both cases.

###### The reduction of the bandwidth shows more surface structures. This works best if the two etalons are matched and also can be tuned for avoiding ghosting. With these instruments by Lunt, this is the case.

With the matched collimation lens set, the LS60THa is fully corrected for coma, astigmatism and de-centering aberrations and provides a full spherically corrected flat-field solar telescope.

###### Blocking filter is the B1200, providing a well illuminated field in photography and avoiding vignetting.

The star diagonal, in which the blocking filter is installed, is equipped as standard for 1.25" eyepieces and with a T2 camera connection.

###### Fine adjustment is achieved with 2" Crayford focuser with 10:1 reduction, which can handle even heavy accessories. Clamping is made via a brass compression ring.

###### Important hint: In humid air, blocking filters might tarnish, so keep yours dry. You can get little packages of silica gel for reducing humidity even more. Put one and the filter into a small freezer bag and seal it.
