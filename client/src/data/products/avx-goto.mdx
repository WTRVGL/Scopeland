### The new Celestron Advanced VX mount for mobile use
Celestron Advanced VX mounts set a new standard for medium-sized telescopes up to approx. 15 kg tube weight. The mount was specifically designed to provide optimum imaging performance. The Advanced VX provides you with many of the features found on Celestron´s most sophisticated German equatorial mounts, at an extremely attractive price and best transportability: The equatorial head itself weighs only 7.7 kg!

Advantages of the AVX GoTo Mount:

-  Solid castings and high torque drive & mechanics -
As successor of the reliable Advanced GT, the Advanced VX mount not only offers big adjustment handles and much stronger motors - offering higher torque for handling load imbalances with ease - but also a much larger polar block and base. The stronger dovetail clamp features two fastening handles. Take images across the meridian without doing a meridian flip! Tracking is possible up to 20° after meridian passage.

- Modern software
The AVX mount comes with the NexStar+ handcontrol unit, offering high performance software features and greatly increased cold resistance. This modern computer control features more than 40.000 objects as well as a multi-language menu on demand. Thanks to the integrated real-time clock the start-up procedure is very fast. The software automatically targets the reference stars, you only need to centre them in the eyepiece. Even the sun can be used as a reference object!

- Polar alignment made easy
With AVX-control there is no need to center onto Polaris: roughly align the mount to north, perform a 2-Star-Alignment procedure and start the All-Star- Polar-Alignment. Now the software helps you to precisely align the mount, even if you can´t see Polaris at all! You can look comfortably through the telescope - no need to kneel behind the mount and use the optional polar axis finder.

- Versatile upgradeable
AVX features an Mini USB port as well as an autoguider and two AUX ports. Here you can connect optional expansion modules, for example:
- " the StarSense Module which aligns the mount and centers its reference stars automatically and perfectly within 3 minutes, or
- " the SkyQ Link 2 Module to navigate your telescope with any smart device and Celestron´s free app "SkyPortal"
