### CCD-cameras by QSI:

Among astrophotographers CCD-cameras from QSI (Quantum Scientific Imaging) count as the highest-quality and most prestigious of their kind. This is not only due to their thoughtful construction, but also their aesthetic and processing quality. The main feature of the 600 series are middle-sized CCD-sensors with very low noise and high dynamic range. The camera-specific electronics, from which other manufacturers of CCD-cameras often show restrictions, are also of the highest quality. As a result the system noise as opposed to the sensor noise is in practice irrelevant; it amounts to only 1/30 of the sensor noise. Whenever then there is a very weak signal and only a few photons hit the sensor - and this is exactly the case with Deep-Sky photography - QSI CCD-cameras shine. With this camera it is possible to get the maximum out of your equipment and location. Next to an uncompromising build quality QSI cameras are also sursprisingly compact and very energy-efficient; in spite of their powerful cooling.

Very cool. Literally!
