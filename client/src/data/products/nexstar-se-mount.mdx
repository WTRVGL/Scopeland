### Celestron GoTo Mount NexStar SE for smaller Telescopes - with Tripod and Wedge
We have often been asked for a compact and lightweight universal mount. It should offer tracking and, if possible, automatic object positioning and of course be versatile, if possible also for astrophotography. The stable and transportable NexStar GoTo mount (small) is a good solution.

Working in alt-azimuth and equatorial mode:

- The alt-azimuth mode: Very useful for visual observation - the mount is set up and aligned within a few minutes, your session can start directly. The computerized tracking system keeps any celestial object inside the field of view.

- The equatorial mode: For astrophotography - the equatorial setup allows longer integration times without field rotation. The necessary polar alignment is done with the polar wedge integrated in the tripod.

The practical quick coupling - Vixen style:
The SE 1 has a useful GP-style saddle plate accepting all standard 2" dovetail bars (Vixen, Celestron, Skywatcher and many more). So these telescopes can be attached directly. Suitable dovetail bars can be found in the "accessories" section.
