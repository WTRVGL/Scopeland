### TS-Optics Hyperboloid Astrograph with 130 mm Aperture and f/2.8

With the 1302.8HNT Hypergraph 130, Sharpstar has created a telescope for mobile astrophotography. With a tube length of less than 40 centimeters, the "small" Hypergraph even fits into airline luggage. On the sky, however, the performance is remarkable. The fast focal ratio of f/2.8 allows you to properly expose an object in just one night, or even focus on multiple objects.

The 2-element corrector offers very good field correction with full illumination beyond APS-C format. With a flat, you can even use full-frame cameras.

The working distance of 55 mm from the M48 thread on the focuser allows easy adaption from all common astro cameras, DSLR and also system cameras.
