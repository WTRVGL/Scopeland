### No telescope type has influenced amateur astronomy as radically as the dobsonian telescope. Before the introduction of this telescope type by John Dobson, the vast majority of amateur telescopes were Newtonians of maximal 152 mm aperture on unhandy and expensive mounts or small inadequate refractors on shaky mounts - just good enough to show the polar regions on mars or the rings of Saturn. Bigger telescopes, like the Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes, were restricted to the relatively small group of amateurs that could afford them.The brilliant combination of simple - but effective - mechanics and the largest aperture available led to a worldwide triumph of this concept. No other telescope type offers you so much light for your money as a good dobson.

Explore Scientific has taken the motto "held together by gravity and driven by yoghurt power" and offer a modern version of the classic - designed by amateur astronomers for amateur astronomers. Despite its large aperture the telescope can be transported easily even in small cars and is assembled within minutes without tools. The construction was optimized for maximum rigidity with a minimum of mass. The combination of big altitude wheels and a optimized aluminium-sandwich construction allows for small movements even at high magnifications. The focus position is already positioned to accept the Explore scientific coma-corrector.
