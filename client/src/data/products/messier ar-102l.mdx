### Bresser Refractor Messier AR-102L/1350 - Optical Tube Assembly
Ambitious beginners and advanced observers alike will see the finest details of our Moon and Planets with the BRESSER Messier AR-102L telescope. Watch details on Mars like the white polar ice-cap, the Cassini division on the ring of Saturn or the great-red-spot on Jupiter. Scanning the lunar terminator is simply a pleasure. You will never give the BRESSER Messier AR-102 Telescope away voluntarily.

Because of the extra long focal length ratio F/13.2 this telescope offers incredible sharpness and contrast but extremly low color-aberration.

The AR-102L is ready to use on Bresser EXOS-1, EXOS-2 or similar mounts.
