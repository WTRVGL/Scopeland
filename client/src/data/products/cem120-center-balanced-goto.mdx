### iOptron CEM120-EC GoTo Montierung for big telescopes up to 52 kg
Recognizing the growing demand for an accurate and stable, equatorial mount with the versatility to carry larger instruments and more complex imaging arrays, we created the iOptron CEM120. It offers the benefits of our revolutionary center balance design: stability, accuracy, and smooth mechanical operation, while capable of carrying a payload up to 115 lbs (52 kg). The center balance designs natural stability is due to its focusing the mount along with payloads weight directly over the center of the pier or tripod.

The CEM120´s performance is demonstrated by its low periodic tracking error of ±0.35 arc seconds even without sophisticated compensation. Along with the stability aspect, the CEM120 features an advanced cable management system consisting of more ports in more locations preventing tangle ups and reducing the chance of fractured cables. It also adds some new features to the CEM family like Wi-Fi and LAN for remote operation and easy to use, reliable clutches on both axes.

7301 is equipped with an HP encoder in RA, that is idal for polar aligned mounts where an autoguider is practically not necessary. According to the manufacturer, the tracking accuracy is better than 0.15". That is fine for amateur astronomers who use the mount permanently errected and do not photograph close to the horizon.

#### Features of the #7301 CEM120 Goto Mount:

-  The EC versions has high resolution encoders for real time nearly error free tracking.
- A new design, center-balanced equatorial mount (CEM) for maximum payload with natural stability
- Observatory astrophotography mount ideal for both visual and Astro-photographers
- Payload of 115 lbs (52 kg) with the mount weight of 57 lbs (26 kg)
- The CEM120-EC uses high precision encoder, resulting in sub-arcsecond PE.
- Easy to use and reliable gear clutches
- Adjustable counterweight shaft for 0º latitude operation
- Precision altitude and azimuth adjustment.
- Precision stepper motor with 0.07 arcsec accuracy for precise GOTO an
