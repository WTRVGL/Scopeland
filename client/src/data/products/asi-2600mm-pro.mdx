### ZWO ASI2600MM Pro - powerful mono astro camera of the latest generation
ZWO has taken another step forward with this new camera. The mono sensor in APS-C format convinces with its extremely high sensitivity and 16-bit data depth. Even with longer exposure times, the stars will not burn out. You get a much better dynamic.

One of the outstanding features of the ASI 2600MM Pro is its sensational light sensitivity. The QE of 91 % by the BACK ILLUMINATION technology and the non-existent amplifier glow make the camera very suitable for all astronomical applications, but especially for deep sky astrophotography.

Further advantages and product features of the ASI 2600MM Pro monochrome camera:

- USB 3.0 for fast download - can also be used with USB 2.0
- DDR3 memory buffer for stable data transfer with USB2.0 - minimizes frame dropping
- No amplifier glow!
- Powerful Peltier cooling up to 35 °C under ambient conditions
- One of Sony´s most light-sensitive CMOS sensors
- High resolution by 3.76 µm pixels - ideal for fast and sharp telescopes like Apos, Hyperstar, Celestron Faststar, Newtonian telescopes etc.
- Supplied with AR filter - full infrared transmission
- Distance T2 connection thread (female thread) to camera sensor: 17.5 mm
- High sensitivity - QE 91 % - ideal astronomy camera for low-light objects
- 16-bit ADC: you can achieve a depth like CCD cameras, but with a much higher sensitivity.
