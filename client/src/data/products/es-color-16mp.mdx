### Explore Scientific Deep-Sky Astro Camera with 16 MP Color Sensor
The high-resolution deep-sky color camera is a nice alternative to the DSLR / SLR cameras and allows high-resolution color images of astronomical objects right from the beginning. Thanks to Peltier cooling, the sensor is always at optimum operating temperature. This makes the images less noisy than with uncooled cameras such as SLR cameras. Thanks to the fast USB 3.0 computer interface, images are transferred in seconds, without annoying waiting times. The camera is optimal for the entry into astrophotography with cooled cameras.
